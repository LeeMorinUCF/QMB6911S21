# .bashrc
# 
# This file will be run each time a terminal window is open.
# You can use it to store some automated commands that will
# set up your workspace as you want it.

# For one, you can add the location to R.exe and Rscript.exe
# to the PATH environment variable so that you don't have
# to add it yourself each time you call R. 
export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/R/R-4.0.2/bin"

# You can also set up aliases, i.e. shortcuts to other programs
# so that you don't need to type as much.
# I will leave that to you to learn it yourself.
# While you are learning UNIX, it is better to type in the commands
# to gain practice at the terminal window.
