# Nonparametrics
Nonparametric methods are used to fit statistical models 
with arbitrary forms of nonlinearity.
We will discuss two forms: kernel smoothing and tree methods. 
Tree methods are often used to determine 
which variables should be in the model (dimension reduction). 
Kernel smoothing methods are often used 
with a small set of candidate variables
to fine-tune the way the variables fit in the model (functional form).
