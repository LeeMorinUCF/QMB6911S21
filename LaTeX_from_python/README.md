# Generating pdf Documents with Python

## Instructions:
1. Run ```regression_paper_gen.py``` in a terminal window from the ```LaTeX_from_python``` folder. 
This program generates a pdf document from automated data analysis. 
1. This python script calls the ```python``` program in the ```Code``` folder, 
which creates tables, figures and text for the document, 
by analyzing an artificial dataset generated with random numbers in python. 
1. At the end of the pythonscript, a call to ```pdflatex``` is placed 
to build a pdf document from the ```TeX``` script in the ```Paper``` folder. 
1. The completed paper will appear as the file ```Paper.pdf``` 
within the ```Paper``` folder.
